# Hand-Count-Recognition

This project recognition number of fingers, which you are showing in camera with help of **Deep learning CNN Model**.

## Details

This project has four files KerasModel.py ,Prediction.py ,Training_data_collection.py ,hand.h5. Training_data_collection.py file contain 
code for collection of training data for keras model. Training data refer collection of hand image which use to train CNN keras model.

For collection of image data and image processing i use **opencv python3 module**. KerasModel.py file contain code for **CNN Deep Learning Model**
which use create weight, with the help of this weight we can recognize hand count.
