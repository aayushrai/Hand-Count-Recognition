## Details

Project contains four files.Training_data_collection file contains code for collection of training data. Training data refer as collection of different hand count which use for train **Convolutional Neural Network**.

**Opencv Python3 Module** used for collection of image data and image processing. KerasModel.py file contain code for **CNN Deep Learning Model** which use create weight, with the help of this weight we can recognize hand count. 

Prediction.py file use to predict hand count, prediction file use weight for prediction. weight save in hand.h5 file.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:-

First install python3 

```
https://www.python.org/downloads/this 
```

Then install opencv module in python3 

```
https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
pip install opencv-python
```

Then install numpy module in python3

```
https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
pip install numpy
```
And then install keras python3 deep learning library

```
https://pypi.org/project/Keras/
pip install Keras
```
